## ***CHALLENGE 2: STORAGE SHOWDOWN*** ($1,497/$1,500)
- 1 SSD, 1 HDD
- Balance Speed and Capacity

![[Pasted image 20240916211157.png]]

### Components:
- NZXT H500 (White) $66
- ASROCK B450M Steel Legend $90
- AMD Ryzen 7 Eight Core 3800X $400
- ARCTIC Freezer 34 eSports (Grey) $35
- Cooler Master MWE 650 Bronze - V2 $70
- CORSAIR Dominator Platinum (4 GB, 3000MHz) $60 x 2
- ASUS ROG Strix Radeon RX 560 OC Edition $165
- Seagate BarraCuda 4TB 256MB Cache $130 x 2\
- Patriot Viper VP4300 M.2 1TB (Aluminum Heatshield) $200
- Cryorig QF120 - Performance $12
- Cryorig QF140 - Performance $15 x 3

The 2x 4TB Seagate Barracuda HDDs provide 8TB of data storage at 5400rpm.
The Patriot Viper VP4300 M.2 1TB provides 1TB of SSD storage along a flooring 6600 MB/s transfer speed.

## ***CHALLENGE 3: UPGRADE EXPERTISE*** ($385/$400)

The ability to make the original computer in PCBS is not possible, but with the power of imagination we can assume that these new parts could be used to greatly enhance the performance of the Memory and Storage of the computer

(No screenshots provided, as the PC with only the parts listed below will not run in game.)

- Mortoni H170 Mtech (Generic LGA 1151 Socket Motherboard) $100
- Intel Pentium G4500 $75
- Shean TITAN XL 8 GB 2133 MHz $60 x 2
- GIGABYTE SSD 1TB $90


The upgraded motherboard now supports low-speed DDR4 ram, alongside the new CPU which supports up to 2133MHz ram. The two 8 GB ram sticks installed in the computer run at that exact frequency, giving proper support to the cpu-motherboard-ram combo. The HDD was upgraded to a 1TB SSD, providing more storage at higher transfer rates and minimal chance of damage.

## ***CHALLENGE 4: TROUBLESHOOTING TRIUMPH

### *Sluggish Startup:*

In this scenario, my immediate thought is that the HDD is becoming worn out and needs to be put in the back-end for storage. The HDD, although great for storage, is not great for immediately pulling information out of that storage. My solution to fix this, for one, is to check the available storage on the HDD. They can slow down immensely when loaded with storage. My next solution, assuming that it's not nearing full, is to get an SSD of some form and make the SSD your boot drive. Have all of your cool fun stuff on the SSD, and have some of your less frequently accessed information on the HDD.

### *The Memory Muddle:

In this scenario, I am baffled that whoever made this computer let the lower clock speed slide under the radar. If the CPU doesn't clock frequency that low, it's simply not going to perform at it's peak. Beyond that, having 2x8GB memory sticks are going to outperform a 1x16GB memory stick any day of the week since the computer can check the information twice as often due to the two channels being split.

Sell the current ram stick, buy 2x8GB sticks clocked at the CPU minimum (or better).

### *The Disappearing Drive*

After first fixing the loose SATA power cable, I would immediately check drivers. Drivers are essential in recognizing information beyond BIOS, and are needed to ensure best drive performance. Beyond that, after opening Disk Management `win + x --> disk management`, check the state of the drive. If the drive is un-initialized, it needs to be initialized and assigned a drive letter for the computer to read from. Beyond this, if this doesn't work, let windows run a diagnostic tool on it. Windows is great at fixing and recovering data that may be broken, and can fix a drive that may have a soft issue with it.

## ***FINAL CHALLENGE: FUTURE-PROOF BUILD*** ($2,443/$2,500)

![[Pasted image 20240916224106.png]]![[Pasted image 20240916224119.png]]

###### "Nothing is bulletproof, there will always be a bigger bullet." - Some guy shooting a Cybertruck on YouTube.

### Components:
- ADATA XPG Defender Pro $50
- MSI MAG Z590 TOMAHAWK WIFI $285
- Intel Core i5-10500 $390
- ARCTIC Freezer 34 eSports $35
- Cooler Master MWE 750 Bronze - V2 $90
- Corsair Dominator Platinum 4 GB @ 4000MHz $80 x 4
- Colorful iGame Gefore RTX 2060 Ultra $595
- Kingston KC600 Sata SSD 2TB $110
- Patriot Viper VP4300 M.2 2TB (Graphene Heatshield) $400
- Cryorig QF120 - Performance $12 x 4
- Cryorig QF140 - Performance $15 x 2

This computer (for this game) represents the cutting-edge. It's got 4000 MHz DDR4 Ram, a 2TB SSD, and, the main attraction, a 2TB M.2 drive clocked at a ground-breaking 7100 MB/s transfer speed. Impeccable. In the terms of future upgrades, it has 2 more M.2 slots left, 2 HDD Drive bays left, and 1 more SSD bay left. It's got room for whatever you anticipate.
